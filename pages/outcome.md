    <hr>
  
<p>While creating our map, we were especially interested in answering several questions:</p>
 
<p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px"> - Did British authors prefer to write novels set in their own country or in foreign lands?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px">- Was there a difference between the genders in this subject?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px">- Which location was mentioned the most in the title pages?</p>
<p style="margin-left: 50px; margin-right: 50px">- What was the most popular narrative form used, and in what time period were those narrative forms most prevalent?</p>

<p>Because our dataset primarily contains British authors, it is not surprising that Great Britain was the most mentioned country and London was the most mentioned city in the title pages for early English novels. The next most popular city was Paris, but that does not mean that France was the next popular country. After Britain, the United States (or the American colonies at the time) was the next most polar region to feature in book titles.</p>

<p>Given the time in which the authors are writing (the 17th and 18th centuries), most of the authors in general are male but we wanted to know which gender was more likely to set their stories in foreign (or even imaginary!) lands. Two of our researchers had opposing views on this matter. Ina hypothesized that female authors would be more likely to write novels set in Great Britain, while Cassidy hypothesized that female authors would be more likely to write novels set in foreign countries. After looking at the map, we found that female authors tended to set their stories in Great Britain. Interestingly enough, even though a majority of female authors set their novels in England, few of their titles mention places found in London. Instead they featured smaller British cities and towns. According to our data only male authors and a few authors of indeterminate gender featured London-based locations in their title pages. See the chart for gender and location differences.

<p> Our sample shows that more male authors were writing novels that explicitly advertised a location in Asia on their title page.</p>

<p>The most popular narrative form is third-person while the second most popular is first-person. There was a rise in third-person narrative from 1750 to 1850, while the first-person and epistolary form was primarily used during the rise of novels from the late 17th century to the early 18th century. 
</p>

<p> We were also able to observe some (loose) patterns around the novels' publication dates. For example, we found that most of the novels that mention a location in Ireland in their title page tend to be published between 1750-1800 (light green) and 1800-1850 (dark green). This is especially noticable given that a smaller section of our sample was published post-1800.</p>

<p> Unsuprisingly, we also found that many of the U.S. locations were mentioned in novels published between 1750-1800 (light green) and 1800-1850 (dark green).</p>
