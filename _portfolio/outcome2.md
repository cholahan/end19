Because our dataset primarily contains British authors, it is not surprising that places in Great Britain were the most mentioned location in the title pages for early English novels.

Given the time in which the authors are writing (the 17th and 18th centuries), most of the authors in general are male but we wanted to know which gender was more likely to set their stories in foreign (or even imaginary!) lands. Two of our researchers had opposing views on this matter. Ina hypothesized that female authors would be more likely to write novels set in Great Britain, while Cassidy hypothesized that female authors would be more likely to write novels set in foreign countries. After looking at the map, we found that female authors tended to set their stories in Great Britain. Interestingly enough, even though a majority of female authors set their novels in England, their titles did not mention places found in London or other major cities. Instead they featured more remote places in the British countryside such as  According to our data only male authors and a few authors of indeterminate gender featured London-based locations in their title pages.
