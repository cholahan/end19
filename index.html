<h1>Geocoding Early Novels</h1>

  <p>Geocoding Early Novels is a project conceived in 2019 that maps specific locations mentioned in the title pages of novels from the long eighteenth century. Our dataset of X novels from 1660-1850 is from the Early Novels Database project at the Kislak Center in the University of Pennsylvania. You can learn more about that database project <a href="https://earlynovels.github.io/" target="blank">here.</a></p> 

  <p>In addition to mapping these novels based on their locations, we have also created maps based on publication date, the authorâ€™s gender, narrative form, etc. You can find the maps here, and more about the project <a href="{{ site.url}}/process/">here.</a></p>

<p>This project was conceived and executed by Ina Chen, Cassidy Holahan, Dorothy Pierre-Louis. Learn more about us in the bios <a href="{{ site.url}}/about/">above.</p>
