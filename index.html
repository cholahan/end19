<h1>Geocoding Early Novels</h1>
<p>Geocoding Early Novels is a project conceived in 2019 that maps specific locations mentioned in the title pages of novels from the long eighteenth century. Our dataset of 2,002 novels from 1660-1850 is from the Early Novels Database project at the Kislak Center in the University of Pennsylvania. You can learn more about that database project <a href="https://earlynovels.github.io/" target="blank">here.</a></p>
<p>In addition to mapping these novels based on their locations, we have also created maps based on publication date, the authorâ€™s gender, narrative form, etc. You can find the maps <a href="{{ site.url}}{{ site.baseurl }}/map/">here.</a></p>
<p>This project was conceived and executed by Ina Chen, Cassidy Holahan, Dorothy Pierre-Louis. Learn more about us <a href="{{ site.url}}{{ site.baseurl}}/about/">here.</a></p>
