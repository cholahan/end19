<h1>Geocoding Early Novels</h1>

<p>Geocoding Early Novels is a project conceived in 2019 that maps specific locations mentioned in the title pages of novels from the long eighteenth century. Our dataset of 2,002 novels from 1660-1850 is from the Early Novels Database project at the Kislak Center in the University of Pennsylvania. You can learn more about the END database project <a href="https://earlynovels.github.io/" target="blank">here.</a> In total, our map plots 943 locations from a dataset of 2,002 catalogued novels.</p>

<p>This project was conceived of and executed by Ina Chen, Cassidy Holahan, and Dorothy Pierre-Louis. Learn more about us <a href="{{ site.url}}{{ site.baseurl}}/about/">here.</a></p>
